                    <p>There is something special about motion. In many ways and circumstances humans have the need and desire for motion. More often than not however our movement is limited. 
                        Generally speaking freedom of movement is regarded as a good thing and the limits of movement are seen as problems to be overcome. I personally want to give my two cents and try to
                        overcome some barriers aswell. What Im writing here are incoherent philosophical ramblings I likely wrote while very drunk. If you are not interested, I dont care; 
                        if you are I also do not care, because this mainly serves to structure my ideas and progressively work on my own thoughts and ethics. </p>
                    <p>In the future I want to touch on different ideas regarding philosophy and especially the crossovers with technology, work, politics, maths, music, gaming and other philosophers. 
                        One of the first abstracts will be "Moving Forward - On Writing", which will serve as a ruleset for me regarding how I note done these texts (I am going to need this). </p>
                    <h2>To touch on a few questions, here is a sort of FAQ/Q&A:</h2>
                    <i id="page-toc-1" class="page-toc-scroll-marker">TOC marker</i>
                    <h3>Why is this titled Moving Forward?</h3>
                    <p>Forwards movement is commonly seen as an ideal of my time and the current political system. I will later define it as an ideal applicable to all my texts.</p> 
                    <h3>What qualification do I have to talk about this stuff?</h3>
                    <p>I was born in 2003 in Germany, so I can talk about the world with a full 18 years of experience and all the white supremacy those other pesky germans had. 
                        In short the only qualification I have are my inalienable freedoms of speech, thought and information every being has. If you think you are more qualified than me, 
                        you can try to tell me better (in this case you are likely as qualified as I am and wrong) or initiate a polite discussion with me.</p>
                    <h3>But what do you want the reader to do?</h3>
                    <p>I want you to think about these ideas for yourself and if you find even the tinyest difference in ideas or conclusions reach out, discuss, spread, publish or do whatever else to make your 
                        thoughts as useful as possible. I just want you to think on your own and these texts may serve as a helper or initiator. Frankly, I want you to digress rather than simply agree.</p>
